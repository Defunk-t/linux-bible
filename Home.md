# Linux Bible

I figured I'd congregate all the Linux knowledge I gain into one place, so that I can repeat things without having to
bounce around the internet. While I mostly write this information down for myself and for friends, I do hope that the
information within will help others to create nice, clean and secure computing experiences.
